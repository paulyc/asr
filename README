ASR is a digital audio processing application for live DJ performance.

Previously developed for Win32 / ASIO and ported to Mac.

Only Mac build is currently working, open mac/mac.xcodeproj and build.

Developed for use with a Core Audio interface and 
CDJ-350 MIDI controller, although it can be controlled entirely with 
a mouse, this is not recommended for proper performance.

Usage instructions:
Select Preferences from ASR menu to set up audio IO. If you only
have one audio output only one track will work. If you select an input
device, that input will be automatically dumped in raw 32-bit floating
point stereo format to a file called output.raw in the working directory.

After Configuring, press 
Start to run the system and 
Load Track 1 or 2 to get some audio to work with.
Supported formats are WAV, AIFF, FLAC, and MP3, 16-bit samples at 44.1 or 48 kHz.

* Press the Play/Pause button to begin or stop playback of that track.
* To change playback position, double click on the waveform where you would like to seek.  
* To set a cuepoint, right click on the waveform or press the Set Cuepoint button. 
* Click Goto Cuepoint to seek playback position to the cue point.  
* The pitch slider can be adjusted to modify playback rate in a range of +/-8%.
* The waveform view may be adjusted by scrolling or click-dragging to zoom and pan.
